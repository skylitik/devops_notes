History of Automation:
Perspective:

1. Bash Scripting
2. Python/Perl/Ruby
3. Powersehll
4. Puppet
5. Salt Stack
6. Chef
7. Ansible
8. Terraform


Use Cases:
- Automation (Any System Automation)
- Change Managment (Production Server chabges)
- Provisioning (Setup Server from scratch/ Cloud provisioning)
- Orchestration (Large scale automation framework)

No Agents (Target machines/Services are accessed by SSH, winrm & API)
No Databases (YAML,INI & Texts)
No Complex Setup (It's just a Python Library)
No residual Software (Push Python package, Execute, Return Output)

YAML - No Programming, Structured
API - URL/Resfull CAlls, Shell Commands, Scripts

Ansible Connections (SSH to Linux, winrm to Windows, API to Cloud)
Simplicity is Beauty
